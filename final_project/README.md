Only gravity ( y<sub>acceleration</sub> = -9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> ) will be applied to the system.  
Point P in each link's local coordinate becomes joint's initial position.  
Point Q in each link's local coordinate is on translational axis (prismatic joint).  
-- 2023.06.06  --  
Axis angle of crack-shaft system's prismatic joint is modified to 0.0 for same week9 practice session's condition.  
Joint(between 0th link and 1st link) position of crack-shaft system is modified for complete constraint condition.  
-> (y position in 0th link coordienate becomes 0.1)
